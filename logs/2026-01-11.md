# Focus on what will stand out

It's been almost two weeks since I started developing the "Crux & Beta" iOS app. Most of the functionalities are done in the sense of releasing an MVP. I'll showcase a bit of what the current version looks like below:

## AR + climbing

The **core AR feature**, i.e., the original motivation for making this app:

- For <u>route setters</u>: a much easier way to upload a climb by simply:
    - (1) taking a picture of the climb;
    - (2) tap-tap-tap to automatically select the allowed holds;
    - (3) setting the starts, while the app handles the rest (mainly registering the reference image with ARKit)
- For <u>climbers</u>: a faster way to pinpoint a problem and its details by using **only the camera**.
    - no need to grind through a 2D flat map on a small screen,
    - no need to scan QR/bar codes to identify a climb.
    - the philosophy is that each climb already has a unique physical signature on the wall.

Some small but meaningful wins:

- Auto-segmentation via a REST backend running [SAM2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2), with consistently good results.
- Automatic hold color detection using Lab color space extraction to pre-fill metadata.
- Thumbnails that automatically center the starting hold, making problems easier to recognize.
- Natural support for workflows that many spray-wall apps are trying to replicate.

## User flow

The **user flow** at a glance:

- Create a problem
- Give/find a beta
- Take a note (text/voice memo)
- Time a session (with Live Activity widge support)

---

All of this works, but this alone is not enough. If this shipped as-is, it would be a solid climbing session note-taking app, but not yet something that truly stands out.

What I actually want–and what I’ve been circling around for a while now–is one clear differentiator. Looking back at what I tried to do [before]([before](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18047308238255136/)), the next step has to be one of these directions:

1. Encouraging climbers to upload videos and directly compare their movement with a successful beta—maybe a body movement analysis tool.
2. Generating structured, auto-annotated beta videos that explain movement, timing, and failure points.
3. Using expressive animations to show 3D reconstructions of gyms and problems—possibly a strong incentive to attract climbing gyms as users.

The next stage is not about adding refinements to existing features. It should be about committing to one of these directions and pushing it far enough that the app feels truly different.
