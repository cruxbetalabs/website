## First gym test session

The iOS app finally reached a state where I was able to test some of the core functionalities in a real gym environment. This definitely an important milestone, not because everything (existed) worked perfectly, but because the product crossed the line from "theoretical" to be usable in the wild.

I tested the app at Mosaic this afternoon and a few things became obvious: 

- Capturing beta shouldn't be limited to static annotations. When a climber finds a problem, there should be a straitforward way to record a video beta directly from the camera view.
- A couple of UI issues: the floating button that opens the beta carousel feels too large and a bit intrusive. It’s functional, but visually heavy; something to revisit.
- The biggest gap, though, is still automatic hold and route segmentation. Manual tools are fine for now, but this will eventually need a backend. Before that happens, the lasso tool has to support multiple selections, since many routes require cropping more than one region. From there, I can imagine auto-cropped routes with padding, animated highlights, and even color detection for circuit-based gyms, potentially enabling auto-suggested grade ranges.
- I also ran into edge cases I hadn’t fully thought through before, like multiple routes sharing the same start or top hold. These are the kinds of problems that only show up once the app is used in a real gym.
- Performance-wise, the FPS felt a bit sluggish in some moments. Nothing catastrophic, but definitely noticeable.

After the session, I recorded a short screen video and posted it on my Instagram story. I got some genuinely encouraging messages from friends, which was very motivating. It made the project feel real, like something people are actually excited to use.

Today felt like a quiet but meaningful checkpoint. There’s still a relative long road ahead, but testing at the gym made the next steps much clearer. I’m really looking forward to getting this into other climbers’ hands soon.
