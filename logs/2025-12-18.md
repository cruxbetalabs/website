A friend of mine shared [this](https://www.opencap.ai/?ref=blog.tjtl.io) (_OpenCap: Musculoskeletal forces from smartphone video_) with me today, and I was excited because a few months ago I was also trying to do the same thing: simulate how muscles are used when climbers do movements via musculoskeletal modeling on OpenSim.  
  
Thinking about it in the context of climbing: when you are not going to do some tricky dyno/coordo moves, you must have said, "Why can't I do that?" or "I'm just not strong enough." But what if we had a way to know which part of their strength a climber is lacking so they would know what to train? I think OpenCap is a great proof of concept that bringing computer vision tools into climbing training has a great future, although the current user experience of this project is terrible in terms of guidance, setup, and so on. Still, it's really nice to see this project and put the topic into practice.
